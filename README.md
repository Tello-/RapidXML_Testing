# RapidXML_Testing

This is some code I made testing out how to use RapidXml to parse XML files. I just wanted to have something separate from the project I'm using it for as a test bed for accessing the different layers of my XML config files. I'm currently planning to use this library for my implementation of Snake also found on my Github.
